Best Buy faced three main challenges in China: lack of localization, unpopular big-box retailer format and established competitors.

 

The Chinese customer was very price-sensitive, and Best Buy's products were more expensive than that of its competitors such as Gome and Suning. Chinese middle-class customers were willing to pay premium prices for well-known brands, but not for Best Buy's service-oriented model.

 

Best Buy's stores were large, spacious, and stocked with knowledgeable customer service representatives. However, this format did not appeal to the Chinese customer, who preferred smaller, crowded, and bargain-oriented stores.

 

The scale of the operation, the huge footprint, the high-paid staff and the way the company works with suppliers eventually contributed to a bloated cost structure. Therefore, Best Buy was unable to shake the status of its established competitors.

 

So, as a case study let's think: what could Best Buy have done differently to succeed in China? Here are some possible solutions:

 

\- Reducing the size and number of its stores, and focusing on high-traffic and high-potential locations, such as shopping malls and online platforms.

\- Enhancing its brand awareness and reputation, by emphasizing its quality, reliability, and after-sales service, and partnering with well-known local or global brands.

\- Investing more in market research and customer feedback, to understand the needs, preferences, and behavior of the Chinese customer, and tailor its product mix and marketing accordingly.

 

These solutions are based on the best practices of some of the successful foreign consumer retailers in China, such as Apple, IKEA, and Costco. They have some common features that contributed to their success, such as:

 

Apple: Apple’s success in the Chinese market is mainly due to its unique and consistent brand image, and its innovative and high-quality products. Apple’s products match the Chinese consumer’s pursuit and lifestyle, and provide superior user experience and social value. Apple also uses online and offline channels to provide convenience, reliability, and security for consumers in shopping and after-sales service. Establishing trust and loyalty, by ensuring product authenticity, safety, and warranty, and by offering generous return and exchange policies.

 

IKEA: IKEA’s success in the Chinese market is mainly due to its unique and fun shopping experience, and its products that adapt and meet the needs and tastes of Chinese consumers. IKEA’s products have high cost-performance, design sense, and practicality. IKEA also builds strong customer loyalty through social media and online communities.

 

Costco: Costco’s success in the Chinese market is mainly due to its provision of large quantities, high quality, and low prices of goods, and its creation of lively and interesting shopping atmosphere. Costco’s goods cover various categories, from food to home appliances, from clothing to jewelry, and can meet the different needs and preferences of consumers. 

 

In conclusion, Best Buy's failure in China was due to its inability to adapt to the local market and customer needs. By learning from the successful examples of other foreign retailers, we can know how can a retailor avoid making the same mistakes and achieve better results in the Chinese market.
