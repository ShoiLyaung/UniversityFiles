Greetings, everyone! First, allow me to thank for my partners' talking. And now, it's my turn to share my point of view with you.

My name is David, and I'm a student from the Department of Computer Engineering and Science. I'm very nervous actually, but I'll try my best.

Let's get started.
(PAUSE)

My partner has already introduced the stereotype of their hometowns. And instead of go wider, I'll go further. I'm going to talk about "How stereotype forms and harms".

Yeah, I made a ppt, but after I finished it, I think it's redundant and useless. I'll not follow it. I'd better start with two equations:
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} , A=Stereotype, B=Observation
$$

$$
Stereotype = Observation + Interpretation
$$

I know Daniel asked us not to be too academic, but I just can't stop myself.

For those who are from department of Science and Engineering, I highly recommand you guys to understand stereotype by the first equation. 

So, what is the observation?

Well, it's easy to understand. We all know that stereotype is a kind of generalization. And generalization is based on observation. So, the observation is the first step of stereotype.

And what is the interpretation?

I think this is not so easy to understand. I'll give you a definition:‘Interpretation is the process of making sense of an observation.’

And now, let's see the process of stereotype formation.

First, we make an observation. Then, we interpret it. And finally, we make a generalization. That's how stereotype forms.

And when we apply stereotype this process goes vice versa. Observation plus stereotype equals interpretation.

Well, the result could be either positive or negative. But as my topic is "How stereotype harms", I'll explain why it's harmful in both cases.

When we are applied with positive stereotype, we try to live up to the expectation.When we are applied with negative one, we are afraid of being "labelled" negatively. This confirms the fact that stereotypes give us strong hints, which would limit our abilities and potential. Perhaps it is those hints that make us fail.

What’s more, stereotype may make us lose the ability to think independently. We may follow the crowd, 
rely too much on stereotypes. Everyone’s onlyness may be covered by stereotype.

And this part is mainly about stereotype never fades away. It's just new stereotypes replace the old ones. So, it's a vicious circle.

And if there must be a take-away point in a presentation, I think this is the take-away point of my speech:	‘The danger in stereotyping lies not in its existence, but in the fact that it can become a substitute for observation and a misinterpretation of a cultural identity.’
